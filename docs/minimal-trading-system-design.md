# Minimal Claude Flow Trading System Design

## Executive Summary
A lean, risk-managed trading system designed for a solo developer with $20K capital, focusing on capital preservation and realistic profitability within 3-6 months.

## System Overview

### Core Principles
1. **Capital Preservation First**: Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
2. **Start Small**: Begin with paper trading, then micro positions
3. **Simple Strategies**: Focus on proven, basic approaches
4. **Gradual Scaling**: Only increase position sizes with proven profits

## Architecture: 3-Agent System

### 1. Market Scanner Agent
**Purpose**: Monitor 5-10 liquid assets for simple patterns
- **Assets**: Major forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD) or top 5 crypto
- **Patterns**: Basic support/resistance, moving average crossovers
- **Frequency**: Scan every 15-30 minutes
- **Output**: 2-3 high-probability setups daily

### 2. Risk Manager Agent
**Purpose**: Protect capital above all else
- **Position Sizing**: Max 1% risk per trade ($200 on $20K)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: Stop trading after 2% daily loss ($400)
- **Exposure Limit**: Max 3 concurrent positions
- **Emergency Stop**: Halt all trading if account drops below $18K

### 3. Execution Agent
**Purpose**: Place and monitor trades
- **Entry**: Market orders only (avoid complexity)
- **Stop Loss**: Always set before entry
- **Take Profit**: 1:2 risk/reward minimum
- **Trail Stops**: Simple 50% profit lock-in

## Trading Strategies (Simple & Proven)

### Strategy 1: Moving Average Bounce

- **Target**: 2:1 risk/reward
- **Win Rate Target**: 45-50%

### Strategy 2: Range Breakout

- **Stop**: Just inside the range
- **Target**: Range height × 2
- **Win Rate Target**: 40-45%

### Strategy 3: Momentum Continuation
- **Setup**: Strong trend with pullback
- **Entry**: On pullback completion
- **Stop**: Below pullback low
- **Target**: Previous high/low
- **Win Rate Target**: 50-55%

## Capital Protection Framework

### Position Sizing Formula
```
Position Size = Account Risk / Trade Risk
Where:
- Account Risk = Account Balance × 0.01 (1%)
- Trade Risk = Entry Price - Stop Loss Price

Example:
- Account: $20,000
- Risk per trade: $200 (1%)
- Stop distance: $0.50
- Position size: 400 units
```

### Progressive Risk Management
```
Month 1-2: Paper trading only
Month 3: 0.5% risk per trade ($100)
Month 4: 0.75% risk if profitable ($150)
Month 5: 1% risk if consistently profitable ($200)
Month 6+: Max 1.5% risk with proven track record ($300)
```

### Emergency Protocols
1. **Daily Stop**: No trading after 2% daily loss
2. **Weekly Stop**: Reduce position size 50% after 5% weekly loss
3. **Monthly Stop**: Halt trading and review after 10% monthly loss
4. **Account Stop**: Full system shutdown at $18K (10% drawdown)

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Launch Requirements
- [ ] Complete backtesting with 6+ months of data
- [ ] Paper trade for minimum 4 weeks
- [ ] Document all trade setups with screenshots
- [ ] Test all emergency stops

- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Create daily/weekly review process

### Go-Live Criteria

- [ ] Psychological readiness confirmed

## Solo Developer Advantages

1. **No Communication Overhead**: Fast iteration
2. **Complete Control**: Quick pivots when needed
3. **Low Overhead**: No salaries to pay
4. **Focused Scope**: Can master 3-5 strategies deeply

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Start Small**: First goal is not losing money
2. **Track Everything**: Every trade, every decision
3. **Review Weekly**: What worked, what didn't
4. **Stay Mechanical**: Let the system trade, not emotions
5. **Preserve Capital**: Live to trade another day

## Warning Signs to Stop Trading

1. Three consecutive daily stops hit
2. Account below $18K
3. Emotional/revenge trading detected
4. System generating too many signals (overtrading)
5. Unexpected technical issues

## Monthly Review Metrics

- Total P&L
- Win rate by strategy
- Average risk/reward achieved
- Maximum drawdown
- Operating cost coverage
- Time spent on system maintenance
- Psychological stress level (1-10)

## Conclusion

This minimal system prioritizes:
1. **Survival over profits** in the first 6 months
2. **Learning over earning** initially
3. **Systematic over discretionary** trading
4. **Risk management over returns**

With disciplined execution and proper risk management, achieving $1,000-2,000 monthly profit is realistic after the initial learning period, which would represent a 5-10% monthly return while preserving the majority of capital.

Remember: The goal is to still have $18K+ after 6 months while learning what works. Profits come from surviving long enough to compound small edges.
