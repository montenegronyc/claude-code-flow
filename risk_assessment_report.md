## 1. Technical Risks

### 1.1 Local LLM Deployment & Integration
**Risk Level: 8/10 (HIGH)**

**Identified Risks:**
- **Model Consistency**: Local LLMs (Llama 3.2, Mistral, Phi-3) may produce inconsistent outputs affecting trading decisions
- **Hardware Dependencies**: RTX 4090 GPU requirement creates single point of failure
- **Version Management**: Model updates could break existing prompt chains and decision logic
- **Performance Degradation**: Local models may underperform under high load (10,000+ articles/day)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement model ensemble voting for critical decisions
- Set up redundant GPU infrastructure with automatic failover
- Version lock models with comprehensive testing before updates
- Load testing with synthetic data to identify bottlenecks
- Fallback to API-based models during local system failures

**Feasibility: 7/10** - Technically achievable but requires significant infrastructure expertise

### 1.2 API Integration Complexity
**Risk Level: 7/10 (HIGH)**

**Identified Risks:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Alpaca API, news feeds, and external LLM APIs have rate limits
- **Latency Sensitivity**: 100ms target for local decisions may be unrealistic under load
- **API Versioning**: Breaking changes in external APIs could halt trading
- **Authentication**: Managing multiple API keys and tokens securely

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust rate limiting and queuing systems
- Use connection pooling and caching for frequently accessed data
- Version pin APIs with automated migration testing
- Implement circuit breakers for API failures
- Use secure credential management (HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager)

**Feasibility: 8/10** - Standard integration patterns, well-documented

### 1.3 Real-time Processing Architecture
**Risk Level: 6/10 (MODERATE-HIGH)**

**Identified Risks:**
- **Data Pipeline Failures**: Redis queues could become bottlenecks
